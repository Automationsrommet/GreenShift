This may or may not fit in with the rest, but as the idea is fresh, I am typing it.

To avoid too much copyrigth violation I wish to call this idea Minetest DTS.
So as the eager ones would already have understood, this is a Youth-With-A-Mission oriented video game based Dicepleship Training School. As I think about it, this school could well be for the already enrolled University-Of-The-Nations-students.
Also the theme of the school would be very transcendentalist-focused and the duration probably nine monts in order to eperience the seasons.
Minetest is an open source clone of minec**** with the bare version free of Mobs or monsters.
