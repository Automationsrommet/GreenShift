This should be an attempt to build a school day structure in a predictable yet flexible pattern.
I wish i knew how Henry David Thoreau and his brother built their day when running their school. So that had to have been a transcendentalist school after witch students did very well in all diciplines, i think.

The idea that have been going in my head today is that each day should have the same set of chapters:

Chapter one:  Music. Choral singing or the like, or perhaps with instruments. Harmonies, at least, should be formed and heard.
Chapter two:  Build something. Digging or carpentry of some sort. Should be physical and serve as excersize as well as expand infrastructure.
Chapter three: Harvest something. This could prove challanging during some seasons, but still should be sought after.
Chapter four: Prepare lunch together.
Chapter five: Eat lunch together.
Chapter six: Clear after lunch and plan ahead. Goals should be set for future building with scetches and drawings.
Chapter seven: Plant something or in ohter way initiate time-consuming processes. could be breweries or other food preperations.
Chapter eigth: More music.
