Industry 0.4 is sort of a reaction to the automation buzz term Industry 4.0 wich seems to mean a range of different things though always heavy on investments and monitoring.
As a contrast I would like to suggest Industry 0.4 as a parallell solution where one in 2023 might start production at small scale with little to none invenstment. Developing slowly utilizing the Open Hardware Toolbox one can reach mid scale production on a shoestring in a private basement having no creditors or investors to look after. To acknowledge the potential that the Open Hardware Toolbox provides inventors in this day and age I thougth I'd give it a name and thus a place in the inustry landscape.
Besides creating the opportunity to start producing at all, this model has the potensial to be as flexible and adaptive as the inventor in question.
Using the term inventor in this context should in my opinion exclude patent applications as these are too expensive for one-man companies anyway.
Also using the existing open source tools as Arduinos and Repraps inspires an open mindset as to share ones inventions to fuel the progression of the open source universe.
The surplus that is created in this model is not money at first, but it is a surplus of knowledge and know-how that is to be invested back into the process to capitalize it further. Money should flow too, enough to make the wheels turn, but for every new machine, every new skill-set learned a whole range of possibilities open, so that the inventor can choose the dicipline most to his liking or get some friends involved.

The Greenshift project in this repository is my attempt to demonstrate Industry 0.4
Some more economic elaboration probably should follow here.
